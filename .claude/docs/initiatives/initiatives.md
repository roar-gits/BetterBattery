# Initiatives

Time-bound work streams. Unlike permanent reference docs, these track active projects.

## Active

| Initiative | File | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| Site spec & build instructions | [BetterBattery-ClaudeCode-Instructions.md](./BetterBattery-ClaudeCode-Instructions.md) | Active — primary spec (463 lines). Full technical walkthrough, site design requirements, content tone, accuracy notes. |
| Site redesign brief | [betterbattery-redesign-brief.md](./betterbattery-redesign-brief.md) | Active — design direction (295 lines). Environmental angle, Claude-assisted setup path, progressive disclosure, visual design system. |
| Impact calculator research | [calculator-research.md](./calculator-research.md) | Complete — fact-check (116 lines). Verified all calculator assumptions against published research. Updated MacBook base, CO2/replacement, lithium content figures. |

## Completed

| Initiative | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Calculator fact-check (2026-02-17) | All assumptions verified. Key corrections: MacBook base 33M→80M, CO2/replacement 80→50 kg, "two years"→"one year" for capacity data. |

## Creating an Initiative

1. Create a new file: `initiative-name.md`
2. Include a status table at the top
3. Track progress with checkboxes
4. Update frequently during work

---

## Completing an Initiative

When an initiative completes:

1. Ensure key decisions are documented in the `## Decisions` section
2. Add a `## Retrospective` section with lessons learned
3. Move entry to "Completed" table above
4. Archive to `archive/` directory (initiative file IS the decision record)
