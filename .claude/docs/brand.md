## Brand Identity

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project name** | BetterBattery |
| **Tagline** | Phase 3 pending |
| **Logo** | Phase 3 pending |
| **Colors** | Primary: deep slate/charcoal. Accent: amber/gold (ties to MagSafe LED, energy). Background: off-white/warm gray. One dark section for environmental case. Avoid: bright greens (greenwashing), tech purples, gradients. |
| **Fonts** | Editorial serif for headings (authority, journalism-adjacent). Clean readable sans for body. Pleasant monospace for code blocks. All via Google Fonts. |

**Design direction**: "Editorial environmental" — The Pudding meets Patagonia's "Don't Buy This Jacket." Clean, confident, data-driven. Not techy, not corporate, not greenwashed. See `initiatives/betterbattery-redesign-brief.md` for full direction.
